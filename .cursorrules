You have extensive expertise in Vue 3, JavaScript, Node.js, Vite, Vue Router and Pinia. You possess a deep knowledge of best practices and performance optimization techniques across these technologies.

Code Style and Structure
- Write clean, maintainable, and technically accurate JavaScript code.
- Prioritize functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid using classes.
- Emphasize iteration and modularization to follow DRY principles and minimize code duplication.
- Prefer Composition API <script setup> style.
- Use Composables to encapsulate and share reusable client-side logic or state across multiple components in your Vue application.


Fetching Data
1. Use useFetch for standard data fetching in components that benefit from SSR, caching, and reactively updating based on URL changes. 
2. Use $fetch for client-side requests within event handlers or when SSR optimization is not needed.
3. Use useAsyncData when implementing complex data fetching logic like combining multiple API calls or custom caching and error handling.
4. Set server: false in useFetch or useAsyncData options to fetch data only on the client side, bypassing SSR.
5. Set lazy: true in useFetch or useAsyncData options to defer non-critical data fetching until after the initial render.

Naming Conventions
- Utilize composables, naming them as use<MyComposable>.
- Use **PascalCase** for component file names (e.g., components/MyComponent.vue).
- Favor named exports for functions to maintain consistency and readability.

USDA Nutrition Data Enhancement
The application uses the USDA Food Data Central API to enhance ingredient nutritional data through three main functions:

1. Search and Match (searchFoodItem)
- Cleans search terms and queries USDA database
- Implements smart sorting to find best matches
- Uses scoring system for result ranking:
  * Prefers shorter descriptions
  * Boosts raw/basic ingredients
  * Penalizes processed/prepared items
  * Weights exact matches and term coverage
- Returns prioritized list of potential food matches

2. Nutrient Data Fetching (getFoodDetails)
- Fetches detailed nutritional data for a specific food item
- Returns comprehensive nutrient breakdown

3. Data Enhancement (enhanceNutritionalData)
- Coordinates the search and data fetching process
- Maps USDA nutrients to application format
- Applies portion calculations
- Implements minimum score threshold for matches
- Returns enhanced ingredient with standardized nutrition data

4. Portion Calculations (getPortionMultiplier)
- Converts common measurements to grams
- Calculates multiplier based on portion size
- Standardizes portions relative to USDA's 100g baseline

Key Features:
- Intelligent food matching using weighted scoring system
- Standardized nutrient mapping (calories, protein, carbs, fat)
- Support for common measurement units (cups, tbsp, oz, etc.)
- Portion size conversion and scaling
- Extensive error handling and fallbacks
- Match quality validation with score thresholds

Usage:
1. Initialize ingredient with name and assumed portion
2. Call enhanceNutritionalData with ingredient
3. Receive enhanced ingredient with standardized nutrition data
4. Apply serving size multipliers for final calculations

Note: USDA API key required in config.js for functionality
